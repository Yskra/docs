# Terms of Use for Plugins in Yskra

Plugins in the **Yskra** application (hereinafter — "**Plugins**") allow you to connect to third-party service providers (hereinafter — "**Providers**") and use their functionality, services, or purchase goods directly through the Yskra interface.

These Terms of Use for Plugins (hereinafter — "**Terms**") govern your use of the plugin function (hereinafter — "**Function**") provided by **Yskra** (hereinafter — "**we**", "**us**", "**our**") and constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us. For the purposes of these Terms, "you" means the user of the Function.

When connecting to a Plugin, you may also be bound by the terms of the respective Provider, which are governed separately and apply in addition to these Terms.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using the Plugin Function, you confirm that you have fully read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by these Terms, as well as the [Yskra General Terms of Use](.) and the [Yskra Privacy Policy](../privacy), and, if applicable, the separate terms of the Provider whose Plugin you are using.

All mentioned documents may be updated from time to time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Function after changes are made constitutes your unconditional acceptance of the updated terms.

If you make purchases through a Plugin, you may also be bound by the terms of a third-party payment provider chosen by the Provider. Such terms are governed solely between you, the Provider, and the payment provider.

## 2. Plugins and Providers

All services, functions, and goods offered through Plugins are provided and managed solely by third-party Providers. These Providers are solely responsible for the operation, updating, and support of their Plugins within the Yskra ecosystem. We are not affiliated with them and do not control their activities.

By using the Function, you acknowledge and agree that:

- Each Provider is **fully and solely** responsible for the content, quality, availability, performance, and security of the services or goods it provides.
- All questions, claims, and disputes regarding the operation of a Plugin, its functionality, or purchased goods/services must be resolved **directly with the Provider**.
- Cancellation or refunds for purchases made through a Plugin are governed by the **terms of the specific Provider**. We do not process payments, do not control refund policies, and are not responsible for any costs or penalties associated with cancellation or refund.

## 3. Payments

We **do not process payments**. All payments made through Plugins are processed by **third-party payment providers** chosen by the Providers at their sole discretion.

### 3.1. Payment-related Disputes

All transactions conducted through Plugins are initiated and processed by third parties — Providers and their payment providers.

We **do not control, verify, or guarantee** the security, correctness, or legality of such operations. Any disputes, claims, errors, losses, or misunderstandings related to payments must be directed **directly to the Provider or the payment provider**.

We **are not liable** for any losses, damages, or harm arising in connection with payment transactions and **are not a party** to any disputes concerning payments.

## 4. Privacy

### 4.1. Data We Transmit

Depending on the method of launching the Plugin, we may transmit some basic data to it, such as: your IP address, device data: model, operating system version, browser type, browser version, interface language (in IETF format).

By using a **Plugin**, you expressly **acknowledge and understand** that this data will be transmitted to the **Provider**.
Furthermore, you agree not to hold us liable for any improper management, use, or incorrect processing of this data by the service provider under any circumstances.

### 4.2. Data You Provide

You may, at your discretion, transmit additional data to the Plugin — phone number, text, media files, geolocation, etc. — to receive services from the Provider.

By transmitting such data, you are **providing it directly to the Provider**, who bears full responsibility for its processing, storage, and protection.

We **do not have access** to data you provide to the Provider through the Plugin. Any processing of this data is governed by the **Provider's terms**. We do not control and are not responsible for their actions.
Any data transmitted directly to Yskra is governed by the [Yskra Privacy Policy](../privacy).
Accordingly, you agree not to hold Yskra liable in the event that the service provider improperly disposes of, uses, or misuses the data you provided, under any circumstances.

## 5. Disclaimer

The Plugin Function is provided "**as is**" and "**as available**". To the maximum extent permitted by law, we **disclaim all warranties**, express or implied, including but not limited to:

- Warranties of merchantability;
- Fitness for a particular purpose;
- Non-infringement of third-party rights;
- Warranties arising from course of dealing or usage of trade.

We **do not guarantee** that:

- The Function, its content, Plugins, or the goods and services provided through them are accurate, complete, up-to-date, error-free, or free from malware;
- Goods or services purchased from Providers will be available, functional, of quality, or will retain their value.

Any issues related to quality, warranties, refunds, or the operation of a Plugin are **resolved exclusively with the Provider**. We **do not participate** in such disputes and **are not liable**.

You acknowledge that **all relationships with Providers** — including purchases, use of services, and data processing — are **solely your responsibility**. We **are not a party** to these relationships and **do not owe you any obligations** of the Providers.

### 5.3. Indemnification

You agree to **indemnify us** and **hold us harmless** from any claims, lawsuits, expenses (including legal fees), fines, or losses arising in connection with:

- Your use of Plugins;
- Your actions or inactions when interacting with Providers;
- The purchase or use of goods and services through Plugins.

This provision supplements the rights and protections provided by the Yskra General Terms of Use.

### 5.4. Precedence of Terms

In the event of a conflict between these Terms, the terms of a Provider, or other rules governing the use of a Plugin, precedence **in favor of Yskra** applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 6. Modification of the Plugin Function

We reserve the right **at any time and without notice** to change, modify, or discontinue the Plugin Function at our discretion. We **are not responsible** for any consequences of such changes on the availability or operation of Plugins.

Providers are **solely responsible** for ensuring the compatibility of their solutions with the current version of Yskra.
