# Getting Started {#getting-started}

To start developing plugins, you need to run the main Yskra project [locally in development mode](../general/installation.md#development), to get access to the functionality for plugin development.

After that, you will have access to the functions for plugin development.

::: tip Developer Tools

At the bottom of the page, you will see a button to enable Vue developer tools.

You can also open them in a new tab by visiting the link <ExternalLink href="http://localhost:8930/__devtools__/" />

*We won't go into detail about these tools for now. You can familiarize yourself with them independently or as needed while developing and reading documentation on some application modules*
