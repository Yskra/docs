## Vue {#vue}

Plugins are built on top of Yskra. And the foundation of Yskra is Vue.

Before diving into plugin development, it's essential to familiarize yourself with Vue. You can start with the well-documented [official Vue guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue) if you're not already acquainted with it.

::: details TL;DR

Instead of reading the entire documentation (it's highly recommended at least to skim through), pay attention to the following chapters at a minimum:

1. [Reactivity Fundamentals](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html)
2. [Conditional Rendering](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/conditional.html)
3. [Lifecycle Hooks](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html)
4. [Component Basics](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html)
5. [Props](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html)
6. [Render Functions](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/render-function.html)

It's also advisable to familiarize yourself with the state management library [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/introduction.html), which allows organizing application state management, but for now, it is not required.
